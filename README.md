Project 3

Dylan A. Russo Cohort 12-B


This project is a basic website to help anyone keep themselves organized when needing to use a to-do list. It is easy to navigate through and the consumer using the website will have no issues understanding how to use it. Many people will use this website for grocery shopping, basic to-do lists, students with their homework, teachers with their daily planning, etc. 

This website will have three different view tabs. The first one will be the to-do list page, the second tab will be a way to contact the website creater with feedback and the third tab will be an "about us" tab. With a simple click you will be able to switch between tabs. On the to-do list tab, you will be able to create your list for whatever you need it for at that moment which will provide you with the option to check off your completed task and also delete the task if it was not needed. 

Technologies used 
HTML, CSS, README.md, JavaScript, Bootstrap, ReactJS

In the future I want to improve the website in many different ways
1. Have a more advanced to-do list for extention features
2. Make the website more attractive to the eye with a better design
3. Upgrade the website based on user feedback

User Stories

1. As a consumer , I want to be able to use the to-do list to help me go food shoping and make my list and check off each item I need when I put it into my cart

2. As a web developer, I need to make a list of what the client is looking for in their website that we are trying to build so using the to-do list can help me make sure I hit each point to make sure the customer is happy with the result.

3. As a student , I will use the to-do list for my assignments and it will give me the easy way to make sure all my work is done on time.
